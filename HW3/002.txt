Given the emerging nature of integrating Blockchain Technology (BCT) into several business fields concerning the Blockchain

collected from initial coin offerings (ICO) websites as well as from an existing, older landscape of applications.

The data set was then intensively analyzed in order to be categorized into five fields of marketing technology.

Advertising and ecommerce outgrew the other fields of social & relationship, content & experience and data in absolute numbers, revealing the focus of practitioners in the past as well as gaps for the future. The authors provided future directions for researchers on and development of tools to systematically generate knowledge and improve the application of BCT and the work of practitioners in marketing.

token the application is using [23]. Tokens play a crucial role in the development of a BCT application. Companies make use of so-called

initial coin offerings (ICO) to increase user numbers and intensify the

traction of their application by distributing tokens amongst the users. By doing so, companies enable investment opportunities and incentivize

users to build communities for, around and within the companies’ vision

and mission [25]. Users base their investment decisions on information distributed in form of ratings by ICO rating websites [26].

BCT can be extended beyond the function of storing information

about the transaction between nodes placed within the interconnected

timestamped data blocks. So-called Smart Contracts allow us to translate

clauses into embeddable code. The resulting agreements between parties,

which are automatically enforced, establish a new paradigm with prac-

tically limitless applications, moving the BCT from second generation,

which include Smart Contracts and a set of applications extending

beyond cryptocurrency transactions, to a third generation “including

applications in government, health, science and IoT” [23]. As stated by Treiblmaier, “the interest surrounding BCT has been fueled by the great

variety of possible use cases” [18]. We will analyze how this interest reflected itself amongst the interest of scholars and practitioners in
