Abstract


In developing world, most decisions by Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) to adopt social media marketing technology (SMMT) rely heavily on study findings from the Western World without much recourse to cross-context differences in structure and managerial capabilities. Thus, the lack of inquiries that provide complete guideline on the adoption of SMMT in developing economies hinders the development of integrated framework(s) that explains MSMEs’ successful adoption. The study used technology–organization–environment (T-O-E) framework as the theoretical basis to examine the critical factors that stimulate MSMEs adoption of SMMT in Nigeria. The adopted methodological choice was qualitative, involving interviews with 20 participants selected from the online directories via purposive and snowball sampling techniques.

However, thematic analysis was the data treatment technique; and the study extended the T-O-E framework to provide an understanding into the dominant factors that specifically influence MSMEs’ adoption, without losing sight of vendors who would rely on the extended framework to get audiences continually satisfied.

Coverage


Samples were taken from Local Government Authorities

(LGAs) in Imo State, Nigeria. Generally, MSME’s operations in Imo State have not met any desired results that would necessitate encouragement of their establishment, suste-nance, growth, and even development by the government and other key players. This is because the margin between enterprises that collapse within their 5 years of existence is wider than those that survive within the same period of existence. This limits their essence in terms of employment creation, economies of scale, provision of facilities, and state of peace (Obi et al., 2016). According to the NBS (2019), the zone in Nigeria that has the highest number of performing SMEs is the south-western states compared to Imo state which is among the south-Eastern states. This shows that MSMEs therein are behind in performance, and the perception of such backslide in performance is explained by their inability to adopt effective marketing channel that will aid their marketing performance. In a bid to have insight into the Figure 1. Analytical framework.

Technology context

Technology compatibility

For us, what we consider first from the onset is the compatibility of the SSMT in relation to the existing application or devices we already have? The answer to this question will determine if we are likely to adopt it or not. (P8) Technology affordability

How affordable is the technology? Often, before a decision is reached a cost-benefit analysis is carried out to establish if such will be relatively cheap and still meet our need and satisfy our clients. (P1) Organization context

Users’ acceptance

What we do most time is to teach people in order to fully comprehend the technology in a way they will better information

appreciate what it can help them achieve. (P4)

Efficiency driven

Can the application assist us in improving our business process on a day to day basis and remain competitive with less stress? If the answer to the question is yes, we are motived not only to try but to implement it. (P5) Owner’s support

We often allow employees ‘input and initiatives in order to help us improve the business processes through the automation of the technology which in turn reduces the workforce. (P4) Environment context

Our clients sometimes, provide information to us about what and how they feel about certain devices, though others that tried certain applications or seen them worked effectively elsewhere, often encourage us to try them.

Before we take a decision on any new application, we often consult and seek experts’ advice in that area of business. This help us in becoming confident about certain applications we intend to use. (S6) Word of mouth
